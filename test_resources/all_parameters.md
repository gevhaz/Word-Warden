# AWAKENING

Slower, he walked along in his thoughts and asked himself:

> But what is this, `whaattt` you have sought to learn from teachings and from
> teachers, and what they, who have taught you much, were still unable to teach
> you?

And he found:

> It was the self, the purpose and essence of which I sought to learn. It was
> the self, I wanted to free myself from, which I sought to overcome. But I was
> not able to overcome it, could only deceive it, could only flee from it, only
> hide from it. Truly, no thing in this world has kept my thoughts thus busy, as
> this my very own self, this mystery of me being alive, of me being one and
> being separated and isolated from all others, of me being Siddhartha! And
> there is no thing in this world I know less about than about me, about
> Siddhartha!

```python
def awaken(self, other, walking=True):
    """Missssspellllining."""
    while walking:

        self.ponder()

        if not self:
            return True

        if isinstance(self, other):
            continue

        if self.deceive():
            continue

        if self.flee():
            continue

        if self.hide():
            continue

        def peel(layer):
            peel(layer)
            return layer.atman
        peel(self)
```

Having been pondering while slowly walking along, he now stopped as these
thoughts caught hold of him, and right away another thought sprang forth from
these, a new thought, which was:

> That I know nothing about myself, that Siddhartha has remained thus alien and
> unknown to me, stems from one cause, a single cause: I was afraid of myself, I
> was fleeing from myself! I searched Atman, I searched Brahman, I was willing
> to dissect my self and peel off all of its layers, to find the core of all
> peels in its unknown interior, the Atman, life, the divine part, the ultimate
> part. But I have lost myself in the process.

[Siddhartha](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2500/pg2500.txt) opened his
eyes and looked around, a smile filled his face and a feeling of awakening from
long dreams flowed through him from his head down to his toes. And it was not
long before he walked again, walked quickly like a man who knows what he has got
to do.
