“You will learn it,” spoke Vasudeva, “but not from me. The river has
taught me to listen, from it you will learn it as well. It knows
everything, the river, everything can be learned from it. See, you’ve
already learned this from the water too, that it is good to strive
downwards, to sink, to seek depth. The rich and elegant Siddhartha is
becoming an oarsman’s servant, the learned Brahman Siddhartha becomes a
ferryman: this has also been told to you by the river. You’ll learn
that other thing from it as well.”
